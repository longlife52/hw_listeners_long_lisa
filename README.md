## Comments

I am curious about the following.  If you could provide suggestions, I would appreciate it!

1. On custom, my 3rd creation adds text on mouseleave. What code do I add to have this event only occur once? Right now, if you brush by the circle multiple times, it continues to add text.  Thank you for additional insight!

2. I really wanted to use scroll as an event. I was unable to figure it out. I did determine that I think the it must be contained in its own scroll box for the effect to work. My thought is that on my sticky nav in my final project, I'd like it to turn transparent as soon as a user begins to scroll.  After research, I think this is a bit more complicated thing that includes a number of pixels down that the user has moved for the event to occur. Any insight or links you could provide would be appreciated.

3. I am curious about how to make the form responsive as well as control the width of the input boxes. I am wondering if I handled this correctly or if there is a better way that allows for fluid responsiveness.

Whew! Another monster assignment that makes me glad that I do not do this for a living! I would be making $5 an hour based on the number of hours it takes me to do simple things. As you can tell from my quizzes, I do not recall very quickly nor accurately. I am a slow learner.
